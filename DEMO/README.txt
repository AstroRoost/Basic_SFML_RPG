Current Objectives
==========

- Skeletons upon death will drop mana potion, and leave a "mana blood trail". They will still bleed red, since they were once "alive"
	The mana just helps "revitalize" the body a bit, technically the other mobs and the player has mana, however to make the skeleton
function, they just need an extra juice at least x3-5 times than the safe amount.

-include +/- music volume


- Slime drop balls and better slime corspse death state
-Slime ball functionality : slow down enemies

-Add mini boss & boss

- player screen damage effect
- improve menu, credit bar
