-4.2 Itchio page account & more:

Updated preview:
# Basic_SFML_RPG - Cave Rat RPG
Basic SFML RPG w/ multiplayer - used as a quick reference pt for a server project main component- VillagerPvP.
-v0 Update README.md : As of now will keep this respo blank until the main components are completed, so it can be "ready in the box" for those that wish to learn / implement your own creativity to your own projects

  ============================= 
- Cave Rat inspiration? 
  ============================= 
     Tunnel Rats, made a documentation while back for ~~college~~ HS about Vietnam war, kept it back of my mind. Figured to make a Fantasy esc setting, with some features from VillagerPvP MC inspiration. Some tweaks from PACKT edu documentation, bing bang boom - Cave Rat RPG is born. kek

- Expect this project to be more so educational/reference/hobby/etc.
Quite enjoy debugging and adding in tweaks, addons, etc. Very fulfilling, and yup once the GPL demo is on Steam it will be M-rate due to "Gore" lel.

#Tribal Class & Other Additions
=========
--Quick_preview_Cave_Rat_RPG_GPL: https://youtu.be/IZ7tkWwrIeM

-v2 objectives previous objectives:
 -Loot Drops , better basic gore,   player screen damage effect,
			menu, credit bar, multiplayer, chat log, commands, buff/debuff male||female , basic INV, 
			bit more mob enemy types, Create Steam Demo Page to get educated on the process

--Current completion
  * buff/debuff male||female - natural gender boost
		-Females: Faster/higher mana re-gen , more nimble = speed
		-Male: Higher defense, attack, stamina re-gen 
	
 * new class & species improvment: Gnomes added, with new class : Tribal
	- Added "tribal" music theme during the dungeon runs with a *twist
	-Enemies will bleed more / leave trail at a better rate  (will work on making it perm instead of clearing once the enemy dies,
	since its more of a visual feature, will leave that alone for now, functionality is main focus atm)
-Tribal Introduction: https://youtu.be/FWXlmLU4A_Q

	- Added music change Numpad9, music mute Numpad8

	-Will include +/- music volume in later updates

	-Slimes will not leave any "corpses" at the moment
		-Updating them so they will drop slime balls, in which you can use to slow down large groups of enemies
		-The corpse will be added later

==========
Current Objectives
==========

- Skeletons upon death will drop mana potion, and leave a "mana blood trail". They will still bleed red, since they were once "alive"
	The mana just helps "revitalize" the body a bit, technically the other mobs and the player has mana, however to make the skeleton
function, they just need an extra juice at least x3-5 times than the safe amount.

-include +/- music volume


- Slime drop balls and better slime corspse death state
-Slime ball functionality : slow down enemies

-Add mini boss & boss

- player screen damage effect
- improve menu, credit bar
- Add multiplayer, chat log, commands
=========
-Loot drops/destructible blocks (can use to craft later)
- basic INV [depending on the item size, it will take up horizontal/vertical space]

==================
Basic Inv Overview
==================
- Skull takes 2 xx
		xx

-Potion takes x

-Sticks takes x
	      x

-Coins x
-Duffle bag of coins : xx
		       xx
(Can use coins to "revive")

-Gems  xx
       xx
(Force lvl up player)

-Wood xx
      xx
-Wood planks xxx

-etc to use either as crafting materials or as is
================
bit more mob enemy types (i.g, mini boss, boss, range enemies, more meele enemies)


-Create Steam Demo Page to get educated on the process

=======

-Perhaps more diverse levels, to suit the mini boss / boss, will consider it later
-Enable player customized chara's before fully starting the game with an option to enable, commands/cheats, enable certain enemy types
-pvp enable, or pve, level gen, etc

-Going to use that as the foundation for creating your chara's for a main project ^_*
